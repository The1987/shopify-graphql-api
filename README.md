# shopify-graphql-api

Create a script (eg: app.js) that communicates with Shopify through Shopifyâ€™s graphql APIs. It takes input product names and fetches the appropriate products that match the name and list down the variants sorting by price.

To run the server run `npm run start`

To search for a product by name run `node app.js -name <product-name>` -OR- run `npm run search <product-name>`
